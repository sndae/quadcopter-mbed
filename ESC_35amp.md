## Description: ##
Designed for planes only, the H-KING escs are an excellent choice for any plane requiring linear, sharp and reliable throttle response on a 35A esc.

H-KING speed controllers have strict end-of-line QC testing and are SMT (Pick-n-Place) in the same room as the through-hole soldering(wires, capacitor) and packaging is done. Improving quality and reducing contamination and inconsistencies due to transportation.

The H-KING 35A includes an XT-60 and 3.5mm gold plugs pre-soldered, plus to make it even easier it comes pre set-up with LiPo settings and Auto cell detection.

The H-KING Speed Controller includes a 2A BEC (Battery Elminator Circuit) to power your receiver, there is no need to have a seperate receiver battery.

The H-KING range of ESCs are both economic and reliable, plus they dont need any setup or soldering. Just plug it in and fly!
